        <h1>Biography of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W)</h1>
        <p>Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is considered the last and final prophet in Islam. He was born in Mecca (modern-day Saudi Arabia) around the year 570 CE, and his full name is Muhammad ibn Abd Allah. Muslims believe that he is the final messenger sent by Allah to guide humanity.</p>
        <p>At the age of 40, Muhammad received a message from God through the Angel Gabriel. This marked the beginning of his role as a prophet. The message emphasized the oneness of God (Allah) and the importance of compassion, justice, and kindness.</p>
        <p>Initially, Muhammad preached quietly in Mecca, facing opposition from the leaders who resisted his message. The followers faced persecution, leading some to migrate to Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia) for safety.</p>
        <p>Due to increased hostility, Muhammad and his followers migrated to Medina in 622 CE. This migration, known as the Hijra, became the starting point of the Islamic calendar. </p>
        <p>Muhammad is considered the last prophet in Islam. His teachings, recorded in the Quran, and his actions (Sunnah) serve as a guide for Muslims worldwide. His life exemplifies qualities such as humility, compassion, and commitment to justice. </p>
        <p>Prophet Muhammad's legacy continues to inspire millions of people, and his message remains a source of guidance for those seeking a righteous and compassionate way of life.   </p>
